# House-Prediction-Model
Prediction of the prices of homes using Data cleaning and modification and then building a model using K-Fold Cross validation to measure the accuracy.

# Linear Regression
Linear regression comes in as a powerful tool to analyze these factors and unveil the underlying relationships. It is a powerful statistical technique that allows us to examine the relationship between one or more “independent” variables and a “dependent” variable.

# Problem Statement
Thousands of houses are sold everyday. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house deserves? Am I paying a fair price?

Introduction About Project
House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People don’t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.
